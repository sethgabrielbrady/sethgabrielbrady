# Seth Gabriel Brady's GitHub Pages Site

Welcome to my GitHub Pages site! This project showcases various features and technologies including JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue 3, and Three.js.

## Features

- **JavaScript & TypeScript**: Utilizes both JavaScript and TypeScript for robust and type-safe code.
- **Vue 3**: Built with Vue 3 for a modern, reactive user interface.
- **Three.js**: Integrates Three.js for 3D graphics and animations.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
yarn
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
yarn build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
yarn test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
yarn test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server. It is much faster than the production build. But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
yarn build
yarn test:e2e
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
yarn lint
```

## Deployment

This site is deployed using GitHub Pages. To deploy the latest version, run:

```sh
yarn deploy
```
